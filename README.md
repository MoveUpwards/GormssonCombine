# Gormsson+Combine

Harald "Bluetooth" Gormsson was a king of Denmark and Norway.

## Requirements

- iOS 13+
- Mac OS 10_15+
- Xcode 10.2+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/MoveUpwards/GormssonCombine.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
